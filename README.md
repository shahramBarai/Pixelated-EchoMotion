# Pixelated EchoMotion

**Note:** This repository contains project code for the course: Computational Art and Design _(completed in autumn 2024)_, Aalto University.

## Description:

Pixelated EchoMotion is an interactive art project exploring the intersection of human motion, digital representation, and real-time interaction. Inspired by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's Body Movies, this project transforms both pre-recorded and live human actions into pixelated silhouettes. Users can dynamically engage with particle-based silhouettes through push, break, explosion, and attraction effects, fostering creativity and connection in a shared digital environment.

## Technologies:

- **Rust** for performance and safety
- **Tokio** for concurrency and parallelization
- **OpenCV** for video processing and silhouette extraction

## Status:
This repository contains the code developed as part of the coursework. While some features are still in progress, the code demonstrates the project's core concepts and technical approach, including video capture, pixelization, and basic particle interactions.

For setup instructions, environment configuration, and running the project, please refer to the `report/Deployment.md` file.

For more information on the project's design, implementation, and future development, please refer to the `report/Design.md` file.
